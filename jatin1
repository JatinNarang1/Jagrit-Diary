I cant stop asking myself why do I hate myself so much.-I should put a trigger on my brain and squeeze it.I am sick of it loosin myself.Its getting to a point where its sad as a fuck.Sleepin pills dont work pain pills dont work.Ive given in my all.
-Fucking Anxiety .My demons are calling and saying they want all of me.I am afraid Ill get the blade and slit it.
